Just "Trimming The Herbs" left and omg I genuinely don't know if anyone will ever beat it legitimately. It is a ridiculous level. Final edit: that level turned out to be a tool assisted upload, which no one thought was possible at the time but apparently it was! But people still persisted and it got beat in the end! https://fgc.network/objects/0f1b42c6-cbb1-49bb-91f5-db81bc71ea14 Been watching some clear attempts and like.. as a person who has played a lot of reasonably hard Mario stuff, everything else aside, grinding Trimming the Herbs (the last level left) looks soul crushing. And it turns out that level was uploaded with a TAS after all, so it is no longer considered to count and they've declared victory. Kinda anticlimactic tbh but GG to the people who got everything to that point!
